# HOOF (Histogram of optical flow)
In this repository, we will learn different types of histograms of optical flow for handcrafted feature extraction from video.
These methods are discussed in [CVPR2015 paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Ryoo_Pooled_Motion_Features_2015_CVPR_paper.html) (Pooled Motion Features for First-Person Videos).<br/>
We have two main approaches for feature extraction from images or videos for machine learning tasks.<br/>
1. One of them is Handcrafted features that we use different methods like SIFT, SURF, etc. to obtain useful features. 
2. And the other is deep learning based approaches that we use the output of deep neural networks layers as our features.<br/>

For some tasks like action recognition, motion information is so essential. Using optical flows for motion tracking is a common method.

For better representation, we can use different types of Histograms. The usual approaches, considering directions of optical flows and the magnitude of them.

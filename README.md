# HOOF (Histogram of optical flow)
In this repository, we will learn different types of histograms of optical flow for handcrafted feature extraction from video.
These methods are discussed in [CVPR2015 paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/html/Ryoo_Pooled_Motion_Features_2015_CVPR_paper.html) (Pooled Motion Features for First-Person Videos).
